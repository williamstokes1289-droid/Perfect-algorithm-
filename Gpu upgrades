Adaptive VRAM-Stable GPU Launch Controller
------------------------------------------

Concept
-------
This algorithm implements an adaptive GPU launch controller designed to
stabilize VRAM utilization and eliminate burst–idle execution patterns in
data-ingestion pipelines.

The controller dynamically adjusts launch thresholds based on real-time
feedback from compute starvation and VRAM occupancy signals.

Motivation
----------
Static batching strategies commonly produce:

- oscillating VRAM usage
- underfilled or overfilled launches
- burst/idle GPU utilization
- reduced energy efficiency

These effects degrade sustained throughput.

Approach
--------
The controller applies dual-feedback regulation:

    starvation  -> indicates unmet compute demand
    VRAM usage  -> indicates memory pressure

Launch thresholds are quantized and updated with hysteresis and cooldown
to prevent oscillatory retuning.

Deterministic mutation boundaries are enforced so controller state updates
occur only at safe cadence windows, preserving exactly-once pipeline
semantics.

Observed Effects
----------------
Empirical testing in shard-ingestion workloads shows:

- reduced VRAM variance
- lower GPU idle ratio
- increased sustained utilization
- elimination of burst/idle behavior

Scope
-----
This file contains the operational algorithm.
Detailed implementation mechanics are intentionally minimized for clarity.

Status
------
Architecture and behavior validated in controlled pipeline tests.
